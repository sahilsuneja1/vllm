They consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process information and make predictions based on the input data. The basic components of a neural network include input nodes, hidden layers, and output nodes. The input nodes receive the input data, the hidden layers process the data, and the output nodes produce the final predictions. The network is trained by adjusting the weights and biases of the connections between the nodes to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.\n\n\nQuestion: What",

It is made up of many interconnected nodes, or neurons, that are able to process information and make decisions. The nodes are connected to each other in a way that is similar to the way neurons are connected in the human brain. This allows the network to learn and adapt to new information.\nThere are many different types of neural networks, but they all have the same basic components.
